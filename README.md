# Waterproof housing for camera

Excerpt:
1.Large opening in the housing, a poor hermetic or waterproof condition of the housing occurs.
2.In order to provide an improved water-tight condition, annular packing 6 is of somewhat greater diameter than clearance between the confronting faces of the inner wall of casing 2 and cover 4, so that when the cover is coupled to the casing, the annular packing is free to deform under compression due to its elasticity, in the manner shown in FIG. 1.

# Lock system

1.The energized solenoid mechanically couples a locking plate member to a camming plate member within the lock mechanism. Once the two members are mechanically coupled together, the operator wishing to open the lock system can depress an unlocking bar which is carried by the housing. Depressing the unlocking bar deflects the coupled together camming member and locking member. This coupled together and deflected combination trips the lock mechanism. The front panel is forced open, away from its locked position, to an intermediate position by an internal biasing spring. The front panel can then be moved from its intermediate position to its fully opened position to provide access to the region within the housing.

# Low-resistance and low-noise portable AUV shape design method based on intelligent optimization of gray wolf group
(website:https://patents.google.com/patent/CN108446481A/en?q=shape&q=auv&oq=shape+of+auv)
1.AUV conventional exterior design goal is usually to minimize the AUV navigation suffered resistance with little consideration of the properties of flow noise AUV.(僅考慮阻力而沒考慮流噪性)
2.多數AUV自噪性很高
3.從能量學來看，噪音降低，聲音震動消耗的能量也隨之變小，進而減小了AUV航行的阻力
4.從流體力學來看，shift position after a turning point, a laminar boundary layer growth period, the resistance decreases; distribution peaks caused by excessive pressure generated locally empty housing bubble phenomenon will increase resistance; excessive back pressure peak is likely to cause adverse pressure gradient causes flow separation and boundary layer transition, thereby reducing the length increases flow resistance layer，壓力峰值過高，會導致局部產生空泡進而阻力增加。
5.阻力最小時，噪聲不一定最低
